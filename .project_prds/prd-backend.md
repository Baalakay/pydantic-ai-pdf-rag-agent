# PDF RAG Chatbot PRD

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Name# PDF RAG Chatbot

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Name
PDF RAG Chatbot

### 1.2 Description
A backend for a chatbot/agent web application that serves as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, enabling customers to ask questions about the information in the PDFs. The application will retrieve the most relevant information from a local directory of product PDF manuals/datasheets and use GPT-4o-mini to generate or synthesize answers. Claude Sonnett 3.5 will be utilized for code generation, while the chat agent functionality is built and validated using the **pydantic-ai**, **pydantic** for data validation **Pydantic Logfire** for observability and monitoring, and **FastAPI** for the backend server.   

### 1.3 Key Stakeholders
- **Product Managers / Project Leads**: Oversee the feature scope and timelines.
- **Developers / Engineers**: Build and maintain the front-end (Next.js), back-end (Python / FastAPI / PydanticAI, Pydantic, Logfire), and RAG pipeline.
- **Sales / Customer Support**: Use the chatbot for customer inquiries and feedback.
- **End Users**: Customers exploring product features.

## 5. Functional Requirements

1. **PDF Parsing & Indexing**  
   - **R1.1**: The system shall parse new PDFs (text, tables, images).  
   - **R1.2**: The system shall store extracted text/tables in a searchable format (in memory or Supabase).
   - **R1.3**: The system shall store extract the smallest and most consise information from the PDFs to satisfy the user query and will only forward that to the LLM for constructing the reply. It should not send large PDF chunks to the LLM, to the extent possible.
- **R1.4**: The system will perform a semantic search allowing for fuzzy searches, and focus on employing only highly accurate search, extraction, and retrieval capabilities.  

2. **Chatbot Query Handling**  
   - **R2.1**: The chatbot shall accept user queries and forward them to the backend.  
   - **R2.2**: The chatbot shall retrieve relevant passages from the PDF index based on the user query.  
   - **R2.3**: The chatbot shall compose a response using GPT-4o-mini, referencing the relevant PDF sections.  
   - **R2.4**: The chatbot shall not respond with information outside the scope of the provided PDFs (minimizing hallucinations).

3. **AI Agent Integration**  
   - **R3.1**: The chatbot’s logic shall be implemented using **pydantic-ai**.  
   - **R3.2**: Data exchange between components shall use **pydantic** models for validation.

4. **Backend & API (FastAPI)**  
   - **R5.1**: There shall be an endpoint to handle chat queries (`POST /chat`).  
   - **R5.2**: There shall be endpoints for PDF management (upload/delete) if required.  
   - **R5.3**: The system shall integrate with Supabase if a database is needed for storing extracted text or logs.

6. **Scalability & Security**  
   - **R6.1**: The system shall handle multiple concurrent chat sessions.  
   - **R6.2**: The system shall prevent unauthorized file uploads/deletions (basic auth or token-based as needed).

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**  
   - **N1.1**: Latency for chat responses should generally be under 3 seconds for typical queries.  
   - **N1.2**: PDF indexing should complete within a reasonable timeframe (depends on PDF size/complexity).

2. **Reliability**  
   - **N2.1**: The system should degrade gracefully if GPT-4o-mini is unavailable.  
   - **N2.2**: The system should not lose conversation logs or indexing data unexpectedly.

3. **Maintainability**  
   - **N3.1**: Code shall follow standard Python, PydanticAI, Logfire, and FastAPI best practices.  
   - **N3.2**: The architecture must allow easy addition or removal of PDF documents.

4. **Security & Compliance**  
   - **N4.1**: Store sensitive credentials and API keys securely (e.g., environment variables, vault).  
   - **N4.2**: Sanitization of user input to prevent injection attacks.

## 7. Architecture & Project Structure

Below is a suggested high-level architecture:


### 7.1 Project Structure

Always consult the .cursorrules files for project structure and be consistent throughout the project


- **docs/**  
  - `prd-backend.md` (this document)  
  - Additional documentation

- **scripts/**  
  - Utility scripts for deployment, indexing PDFs, etc.
  - Use PIP for installation of packages and libraries where possible.

---

## 8. Implementation Details

### 8.1 Multi-Agent vs. Single-Agent
- **Recommended**: A **single-agent** architecture, with the possibility of layering in specialized “sub-agents” if needed (for example, an “image or table extraction agent”). However, the simplest approach is to have one main agent controlling the retrieval and generation.  
- If you foresee multiple specialized tasks (e.g., a separate agent for table-based extraction, another for text-based Q&A, etc.), consider **multi-agent** design. But be mindful of complexity.

### 8.2 Database Integration
- **Supabase** can be used for:  
  - Storing extracted text metadata and embeddings (if you want to do advanced vector search).  
  - Storing chat logs (optional).  
  - Managing user accounts and authentication (optional).

### 8.3 API & RAG Flow
2. **FastAPI** calls a RAG service, which uses an embedding store (Supabase or an in-memory store) to retrieve relevant PDF sections.  
3. The retrieved text is combined into a prompt for GPT-4o-mini.  
4. GPT-4o-mini returns a response.  
5. The response is wrapped with pydantic models to ensure valid structure, then returned to the front-end.

### 8.4 Security
- Use tokens or keys to protect the FastAPI endpoints.  
- Validate all file uploads.

## 9. Additional Topics & Considerations

1. **Metadata & Versioning**  
   - Keep track of PDF version or date of upload to ensure customers are referencing the correct version.  
   - Possibly store checksums/hashes of PDFs for integrity checks.

2. **Search & Filtering**  
   - Consider implementing advanced search functionalities (by product name, sensor type, etc.).  
   - Add filtering for customers to quickly narrow down product lines.

3. **Logging & Monitoring**  
   - Log user queries for analytics, improvement, and detection of repeated issues.  
   - Monitor usage to gauge performance and scale accordingly.

4. **Analytics & Feedback Loop**  
   - Track how often the bot’s answers are accepted or flagged by users, to further refine the RAG pipeline.  
   - Consider a thumbs-up/thumbs-down feedback mechanism.

5. **Error Handling & Retries**  
   - Provide graceful fallbacks if GPT-4o-mini API fails.  
   - Alert on repeated PDF parsing or indexing failures.

6. **Future Enhancements**  
   - Integration with voice-based interaction.  
   - Automatic summarization of entire PDFs.  
   - Multi-lingual support if targeting international customers.
