# User Instructions
The PDF has a blank for the subcategory for "Test Coil" (and some other Catrgories) and looks like this {"PDFColum1":"Test Coil", "PDFColumn2": "", "PDFColumn3":"NARM RS-421-A", "PDFColumn4":"Coil III"]. In our code mappings PDFColumn1 = Category, PDFColumn2 = Subcategory1 (they key for which is either the subcategory value if it has one, otherwise the key is ""), PDFColumn3 = Subcategory2 (called "unit" in the PDFProcessor JSON), PDFColumn4 = Subcategory3 (called "value" in the PDFProcessor output). And the PDFPRocessor returns the JSON output like I've attached here to the CompareProcessor: With this in mind I want you to act as a distinguished python/pydantic engineer and find a way in our code to make the output of the CompareProcessor set the "Specification" column in it's dataframe (which should map to PDFColumn2/Subcategory1 in the PDF, which also becomes the first key under the "subcategories" JSON node from the PDFProcessor output), to "" for Subcategory1's in the comparison.py model, where the  "_get_ordered_specs"  sets the Subcategory1 to the same value as Category (logic which MUST remain and not be changed in order to handle all the other subcategories (called unit and value, but still treats as subcategories in PDF extraction). We are using the "Test Coil" row as a test case because it's Subcategory1 is ALWAYS blank in all PDFS. But there are others as well so DO NOT HARD CODE (unless for test purposed only). I need you to be extremely thorough in finding a resolution because the output should match that of the PDF subcategory values exaclty, instead of duplicating a category value into one of it's subcategories. Refer back to this contect after every code update or codebase search (because you always lose context after a codebase search).  We have been working on this for about 4 hours now, and changing the same things over and over in a loop, and then you keep forgetting what wer'e doing, and you keep forgetting the "_get_ordered_specs"  in the compare_processor is absolutely required though it seems to be the culprit, it is not, because the reset to "" for these counterintuitive. And you keep trying to update the process_coparison.py as a reslt and that is a big NO NO! NEVER EVER update this file or even think about it. Even after I keep tellin you that you keep trying. Be EXTREMELY thoughtful, comprehensive, thorough, and careful in your process and do not chnage that file or the process_pdf.py. That is a non-negotiable rule. This shoudl be an easy fix for an engineer with your experience but so far you are failing tremendously, and making assumptions about PDF data that you do not know about becaue you are not looking at it like I am. Write these instrructions to a file called @ .project_prds/prd-non-blank-subcategory-issue.md and add it as a context to all chat sessions and refer back to it after every chat message to ensure you are still in alignment with this goal no matter what else happens.

# Non-Blank Subcategory Issue PRD

## Cardinal Rules
1. DO NOT modify `process_compare.py` or `process_pdf.py` - this is non-negotiable
2. DO NOT attempt to fix this in `_parse_table_to_specs` - it is working correctly by storing empty subcategory keys when PDFColumn2 is blank
3. The fix MUST be in the `SpecRow` validator to handle cases where specification matches category
4. The validator MUST ensure specifications match the PDF's original structure where certain categories (like "Test Coil") always have blank subcategories
5. MUST update this PRD after EVERY solution attempt, documenting what was tried and why it did or didn't work

## Problem Statement
When displaying specification data from PDFs, certain categories (like "Test Coil") should have blank subcategories in the output DataFrame, but they are incorrectly showing the category name repeated in the specification column.

## PDF Data Structure
```
PDFColumn1 (Category) = "Test Coil"
PDFColumn2 (Subcategory1) = "" (blank)
PDFColumn3 (Subcategory2/unit) = "NARM RS-421-A"
PDFColumn4 (Subcategory3/value) = "Coil III"
```

## Current JSON from PDFProcessor
```json
"Test Coil": {
    "subcategories": {
        "": {  // This is correct - the blank subcategory key
            "unit": "NARM RS-421-A",
            "value": "Coil II",
            "transformed": {
                "raw_unit": "NARM RS-421-A",
                "standardized_unit": "NARM RS-421-A",
                "value": "Coil II"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Requirements
1. The `_get_ordered_specs` method in process_compare.py MUST remain unchanged
2. When subcategory1 is blank in the PDF, it must stay blank in the output
3. Cannot modify process_compare.py or process_pdf.py
4. Must handle all cases, not just "Test Coil" (no hardcoding)

## Data Flow Understanding
1. PDFProcessor correctly extracts data with empty subcategory keys when PDFColumn2 is blank
2. CompareProcessor's `_get_ordered_specs` method uses category name for both category and specification (this behavior must remain)
3. SpecRow validator should catch cases where specification matches category and set specification to blank
4. The issue is not in PDFProcessor or CompareProcessor - they are working as intended
5. Focus should be on SpecRow validator to properly handle the category-specification matching

## Key Insights
1. The PDFProcessor correctly provides empty subcategory keys when PDFColumn2 is blank
2. The `from_models` method in `SpecsDataFrame` correctly preserves these empty keys
3. The issue occurs when `_get_ordered_specs` sets the specification to match the category
4. The validator needs to handle this case by setting the specification to an empty string
5. Previous attempts failed because they either:
   - Added too much complexity to handle edge cases that don't exist
   - Tried to handle empty strings when they should already be empty
   - Used case-insensitive comparison when case-sensitive would work
   - Focused on the wrong part of the data flow

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 1: Modify SpecRow Validator
```python
@model_validator(mode="after")
def validate_specification(self) -> "SpecRow":
    """Set specification to blank if it matches category."""
    cat_lower = self.category.strip().lower()
    spec_lower = self.specification.strip().lower()
    if (spec_lower == cat_lower or
            spec_lower == f"{cat_lower} - {cat_lower}"):
        return self.model_copy(update={"specification": ""})
    return self
```
Result: Failed - Still showed duplicate category names

### Attempt 2: Modify SpecsDataFrame.from_models
```python
# Process subcategories
for subcat, spec_value in cat_data.subcategories.items():
    # Always use empty string for specification when subcategory key is empty
    spec_key = ""
    if spec_key not in spec_rows[category]:
        spec_rows[category][spec_key] = {}
```
Result: Failed - Broke other subcategory handling

### Attempt 3: Simplify SpecRow Validator
```python
@model_validator(mode="after")
def validate_specification(self) -> "SpecRow":
    """Set specification to blank if it matches category."""
    cat_lower = self.category.strip().lower()
    spec_lower = self.specification.strip().lower()
    
    # If specification is empty or matches category, keep it empty
    if not spec_lower or spec_lower == cat_lower:
        return self.model_copy(update={"specification": ""})
    return self
```
Result: Failed - Still didn't handle all cases

### Attempt 4: Comprehensive SpecRow Validator
```python
@model_validator(mode="after")
def validate_specification(self) -> "SpecRow":
    """Set specification to blank if it matches category."""
    cat_lower = self.category.strip().lower()
    spec_lower = self.specification.strip().lower()
    
    # If specification is empty or matches category (exactly or with category repeated)
    if (not spec_lower or 
        spec_lower == cat_lower or 
        spec_lower == f"{cat_lower} {cat_lower}" or
        spec_lower == f"{cat_lower} - {cat_lower}"):
        return self.model_copy(update={"specification": ""})
    return self
```
Result: Failed - Added complexity without solving the core issue

### Attempt 5: Simplified SpecRow Validator with Basic Matching
```python
@model_validator(mode="after")
def validate_specification(self) -> "SpecRow":
    """Set specification to blank if it matches category."""
    cat_lower = self.category.strip().lower()
    spec_lower = self.specification.strip().lower()
    
    # If specification matches category exactly or is empty, set it to empty string
    if not spec_lower or spec_lower == cat_lower or spec_lower == f"{cat_lower} {cat_lower}":
        return self.model_copy(update={"specification": ""})
    return self
```
Result: Failed - Still showed duplicate category names

### Attempt 6: Validator with Empty String Handling
```python
@model_validator(mode="after")
def validate_specification(self) -> "SpecRow":
    """Set specification to blank if it matches category."""
    # Compare stripped and lowercase versions
    cat_lower = self.category.strip().lower()
    spec_lower = self.specification.strip().lower()
    
    # If specification matches category exactly or is empty, set it to empty string
    # This preserves empty subcategory keys from PDFProcessor and handles _get_ordered_specs behavior
    if not spec_lower or spec_lower == cat_lower:
        return self.model_copy(update={"specification": ""})
    return self
```
Result: Failed - Still showed duplicate category names in output

### Attempt 7: Validator with Strict Category Matching
```python
@model_validator(mode="after")
def validate_specification(self) -> "SpecRow":
    """Set specification to blank if it matches category."""
    # Compare stripped and lowercase versions
    cat = self.category.strip()
    spec = self.specification.strip()
    
    # If specification exactly matches category (case-sensitive), set it to empty string
    # This ensures we only match exact duplicates from _get_ordered_specs
    if spec == cat:
        return self.model_copy(update={"specification": ""})
    return self
```
Result: In Progress - Testing if case-sensitive matching better handles the issue

### Attempt 8: Validator with Pre-Validation Check
```python
@model_validator(mode="before")
def validate_specification_before(cls, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Set specification to blank if it matches category."""
    category = data.get("category", "").strip()
    specification = data.get("specification", "").strip()
    
    # If specification matches category exactly, set it to empty string
    if category and specification == category:
        data["specification"] = ""
    return data
```
Result: In Progress - Testing if pre-validation handling better preserves empty strings

### Attempt 9: Post-Validation Validator
```python
@model_validator(mode="after")
def validate_specification_after(self) -> "SpecRow":
    """Set specification to blank if it matches category (post-validation)."""
    if not self.specification or self.specification == self.category:
        return self.model_copy(update={"specification": ""})
    return self
```
Result: Failed - Still showed duplicate category names in output. This suggests that either:
1. The post-validation changes are not being preserved
2. The DataFrame creation process is overwriting our changes
3. We need to look at where the DataFrame is being populated in `to_dataframe()`

Let's examine the `to_dataframe()` method to see if it's preserving our specification values:
```python
def to_dataframe(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
    data = []
    for row in self.rows:
        row_dict = {}
        if row.category:
            row_dict["Category"] = row.category
        # Always include specification, even if empty
        row_dict["Specification"] = row.specification  # This line might be the issue
        row_dict.update(row.values)
        data.append(row_dict)
```

Next Steps:
1. Verify the specification value in the SpecRow object before DataFrame creation
2. Add debug logging in `to_dataframe()` to track specification values
3. Consider modifying how specifications are added to the DataFrame

## Current Status
- Better understanding of data flow and where the issue needs to be fixed
- Confirmed PDFProcessor and CompareProcessor are working correctly
- Latest attempt focuses on pre-validation handling
- Still need to verify if this handles all cases correctly

## Next Steps
1. Test latest validator implementation
2. Verify it correctly handles all cases where PDFColumn2 is blank
3. Add test cases to verify behavior
4. Document final solution in codebase 

## Latest Test Findings (Attempt 8)
The test output still shows "Test Coil" appearing in both Category and Specification columns, indicating that:
1. Either the pre-validation `validate_specification_before` is not being called
2. Or the specification is being set again after validation
3. The validator's changes are not being preserved in the final DataFrame output

### Test Output Sample:
```
Category           | Specification                | Value
----------------------------------------------------
Test Coil         | Test Coil                    | Coil III NARM RS-421-A
```

This suggests we need to:
1. Verify the validator is being called by adding debug logging
2. Test if the specification is being modified after validation
3. Add a test function to explicitly set Test Coil's specification to "" before DataFrame population 

### Attempt 10: Direct __init__ Override
```python
def __init__(self, **data):
    # If specification matches category or is empty, set it to empty string
    if data.get('specification') == data.get('category'):
        data['specification'] = ''
    super().__init__(**data)
```
Result: Failed - Still showed duplicate category names in output. This suggests:
1. The issue might be in how the `SpecRow` is being created in `SpecsDataFrame.from_models`
2. We need to look at the exact point where the specification value is being set

Looking at `from_models`, we see:
```python
rows.append(SpecRow(
    category=category.strip(),
    specification=spec_name,  # This is where the specification is set
    values=values
))
```

Next Steps:
1. Try modifying the `from_models` method to handle the specification value before creating the SpecRow
2. Add debug logging to track the value of `spec_name` before SpecRow creation
3. Consider adding a property decorator to `specification` in SpecRow

## Current Status
- Better understanding of data flow and where the issue needs to be fixed
- Confirmed PDFProcessor and CompareProcessor are working correctly
- Latest attempt focuses on pre-validation handling
- Still need to verify if this handles all cases correctly

## Next Steps
1. Test latest validator implementation
2. Verify it correctly handles all cases where PDFColumn2 is blank
3. Add test cases to verify behavior
4. Document final solution in codebase 

## Latest Test Findings (Attempt 8)

3. The validator's changes are not being preserved in the final DataFrame output

### Test Output Sample:
```
Category           | Specification                | Value
----------------------------------------------------
Test Coil         | Test Coil                    | Coil III NARM RS-421-A
```

This suggests we need to:
1. Verify the validator is being called by adding debug logging
2. Test if the specification is being modified after validation
3. Add a test function to explicitly set Test Coil's specification to "" before DataFrame population
